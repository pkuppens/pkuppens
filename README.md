## Hi there, I'm Pieter Kuppens

I'm an experienced software, data, and AI professional passionate about solving innovative and complex challenges.

My career spans large Dutch organizations like ASML, Philips, and ABN AMRO, as well as innovative startups like
CART-Tech and Nemo Healthcare.
Iâ€™ve worked in healthcare, finance, and high-tech industries, building impactful solutions that deliver value:

- Use Deep Learning for cardiac tissue segmentation to assist in pacemaker lead placement
- Using Artificial Intelligence Anomaly Detection to detect possible fraud in financial transactions
- 3D computer visualization to assist in ablation interventions
- Topic and sentiment analysis in Natural Language Processing
- EUV source positioning in the first ASML EUV Demo machines
- JIRA Process Automation in Medical Device Development
- Implement Decision Rules for Medication Prescriptions
- Integrating maternal blood pressure/saturation measurements with maternal/fetal heart rate data into the hospital systems.

## What You'll Find Here

My GitHub repositories offer a glimpse into my ideas, showcasing small, non-disclosed portfolio notebook pieces from broader projects.
While these examples represent only a fraction of my expertise, they demonstrate my approach to creating innovative and impactful solutions,
from an abstract idea to a working proof of concept, though usually not yet the production-quality code.

### `git_util_scripts`

I also added two utility scripts that help me organize and update my git repos.

## Interests

- Building AI and data-driven solutions, with Deep Learning, Large Language Models, Machine Learning, Agentic AI, etc.
- Exploring innovative ways to solve technical challenges in socially relevant contexts
- Collaborating on meaningful, high-impact projects, in Healthcare, Finance, Renewable Energy
- Freelance opportunities near Den Bosch (the Netherlands) or (largely) remote.
